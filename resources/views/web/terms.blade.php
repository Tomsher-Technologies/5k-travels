                        <p>In order to guarantee the security of online payments and any other transactions involving personal data, the website employs SSL (Secure Socket Layer) technology. SSL encrypts all communication between your computer/mobile device and our server, ensuring that the information is comprehensible and accessible only to us. A secure connection is typically indicated by a closed lock on your browser window. Refer to your browser's security specifications for more details. Transactions are automatically secured if your browser supports SSL. A closed lock at the bottom of the browser is the widely recognized indicator of a secure site. Your information remains secure and encrypted as long as the lock icon remains closed, preventing any potential misuse.<p>
                        <p>If, after clicking the secure transaction link, the closed lock is not visible, it may be due to the window being nested in another frame. To confirm a secure connection (in Internet Explorer), right-click and select "Properties," then navigate to "Certificates." This will indicate whether the connection is secure. Alternatively, in Netscape Navigator, right-click and choose 'View Frame Info' at the bottom of the text to access security information.<p>
